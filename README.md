# SpringJourney
## There and back again. A Spring framework journey.

Hi! In this repository, you'll find a series of simple projects that will help you get started with the Spring framework. 
In each project, you'll find a README file containing notes on the topic being discussed with references to the tutorial code.

Here the list of the topics:

1) Application Context, @Bean and @Configuration
2) Another way to define Beans - @Component
3) @Service, @Repository and DI with @Autowired
